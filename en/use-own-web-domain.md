### Using your own Web-Domain

The usage of a custom Domain for your GDPS is a **paid** premium feature. This is only a one-time payment of 2â‚¬ - Boosting the server will not grant you the usage of a custom domain.  
If you wish to use a custom Domain, please make a [ticket](https://canary.discord.com/channels/743013350446989442/824556818667405343/856122016675528724) in the [GDPS Free Hosting Discord server](http://discord.fhgdps.com/) stating that you want to use a custom Domain for your GDPS.
