## How to make yourself Mod
So there are 2 ways you can make yourself mod, that is through the **GDPS Manager** Bot the Hosting provides. Or manually through the Databases.

So first you want to be logging into your **GDPS PHPMyAdmin Database**. *(The GDPS Bot Creator sent you the details)*

After logging in you will see to things in a row "information_schema" and your GDPS, click on your GDPS and then select "roles".

In there you will see 4 Roles: **Owner, Elder Mod, Mod & Default**.
Now to make yourself Owner, you need to get the RoleID of that Role.

Now you want to get your Account ID, which you can get by going to "accounts" and looking for your username.

Now go to "roleassign", since this is where you will be adding yourself to Mod.

At the top, you will see some row with buttons. Click on "insert".

Then you would see something like this, fill in this and click the "Go" button.
