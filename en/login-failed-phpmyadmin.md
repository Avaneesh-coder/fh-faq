### Login Failed PHPMyAdmin (Android)
The password is not that easily cobyable due to Discord not allowing to simply select specific text on mobile versions.  
Due to this, people kept mistyping the password by a few characters or mix up I with l.

#### Option 1: Browser Discord
You can use the browser version of Discord to copy the text properly. A message will appear that you shouldn't use the browser version on mobile, though there's a dark/hidden cross button on the top right that allows you to visit the page anyways. Log into Discord and navigate to the GDPS-Creator Bot's message. From there on, you can hold on the password text to mark it. A pop-up will appear with a few options, including the ability to copy the text directly. Make sure to not include any other text.
#### Option 2: Copy and trim
You can use the `ps!logininfo` command to receive a shorter message with your password to access the database.

You will need to go to the <b>#gdps-creator-commands</b> channel on the GDPSFH Server.

And then you need to type out `ps!logininfo` and send it in there. <b><i>Make sure your Private Messages are enabled!</i></b>

Afterwords you should have gotten a Private Message from the bot containing your Login Information.

You can copy the message and then paste it again. Afterwards, remove anything but the password itself until you're left with only the password, and/or only copy the password itself.
