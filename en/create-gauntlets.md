Creating gauntlets is fairly easy and is actually super simple.  
  
First go to gauntlets in your database as shown here  
![img](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743027678046846999/781569736319303720/unknown.png)
it will display some stuff in the top (middle upper corner)  
choose insert as you want to make a new one.

ID = the gauntlet, gauntlet √çD's are displayed above  
level1,2,3,4,5 are the levels in the gauntlet  
ex. level1 is the first one and level4 is the fourth one.  
  
if that's not how it's sorted it's from the lowest level id that goes first.  
and the highest, last

now just scroll/look at the bottom where it says Go  
  
you should now have a gauntlet on your gdps!
